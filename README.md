WriteHERE is an open-source framework that revolutionizes long-form writing through human-like adaptive planning. Unlike traditional AI writing tools that follow rigid workflows, WriteHERE dynamically decomposes writing tasks and integrates three fundamental capabilities:

1. **Recursive Planning**: Breaks down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks
2. **Heterogeneous Integration**: Seamlessly combines retrieval, reasoning, and composition
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusts the writing process in real-time based on context

Our evaluations show that this approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both fiction writing and technical report generation.

## üîç Overview

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns, this framework:

1. **Eliminates workflow restrictions** through a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution
2. **Facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition** by integrating different task types
3. **Adapts dynamically** during the writing process, similar to human writing behavior

Our evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation demonstrate that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.

## üåê Open Source Philosophy

WriteHERE is developed with these core principles:

- **Fully Open Source**: All code is freely available for use, modification, and distribution under the MIT License
- **Non-Commercial**: Developed for research and educational purposes without commercial interests
- **Full Transparency**: The entire system architecture and decision-making processes are transparent to users
- **Community-Driven**: We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaborative improvements from the community

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js 14+ (for the frontend)
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Anthropic (Claude models)
  - SerpAPI (for search functionality in report generation)

### Quickstart

You can use WriteHERE in two ways: with or without the visualization interface.

#### Running Without Visualization

This is the simpler approach when you don't need real-time visualization or want to use the engine for batch processing.

1. **Setup the environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -v -e .

# Create api_key.env file based on example
cp recursive/api_key.env.example recursive/api_key.env
# Edit the file to add your keys
nano recursive/api_key.env
```


2. **Run the engine directly**:
```bash
cd recursive
python engine.py --filename <input_file> --output-filename <output_file> --done-flag-file <done_file> --model <model_name> --mode <story|report>
```

Example for generating a story:
```bash
python engine.py --filename ../test_data/meta_fiction.jsonl --output-filename ./project/story/output.jsonl --done-flag-file ./project/story/done.txt --model gpt-4o --mode story
```

Example for generating a report:
```bash
python engine.py --filename ../test_data/qa_test.jsonl --output-filename ./project/qa/result.jsonl --done-flag-file ./project/qa/done.txt --model claude-3-sonnet --mode report
```

#### Running With Visualization Interface

This option provides a web interface to visualize and monitor the writing process in real-time.

1. **One-step setup and launch**:
```bash
./setup_env.sh  # One-time setup of the environment
./start.sh      # Start the application
```

This will:
- Create a clean Python virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies
- Start the backend server on port 5001
- Start the frontend on port 3000
- Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

You can customize the ports using command-line arguments:
```bash
./start.sh --backend-port 8080 --frontend-port 8000
```

#### For Anaconda/Miniconda Users

If you're using Anaconda and encounter dependency conflicts, use:
```bash
./run_with_anaconda.sh
```

This script creates a dedicated Anaconda environment called 'writehere' with the correct dependencies and runs both servers.

You can customize ports with this script:
```bash
./run_with_anaconda.sh --backend-port 8080 --frontend-port 8000
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up the components manually:

#### Backend Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install main dependencies:
```bash
pip install -v -e .
```

3. Install backend server dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

To use a custom port:
```bash
python server.py --port 8080
```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

To use a custom port:
```bash
PORT=8000 npm start
```

## üìä Real-time Task Visualization

When using the visualization interface, you can see the task execution process in real-time. As the agent works on generating content, you can observe:

1. The hierarchical decomposition of tasks
2. Which tasks are currently being worked on
3. The status of each task (ready, in progress, completed)
4. The type of each task (retrieval, reasoning, composition)

This visualization provides insight into the agent's "thinking process" and helps you understand how complex writing tasks are broken down and solved step by step.
